<h1>My background / interests</h1>
<p>
I went into the military immediately following high school (had the grades but couldn't afford college).  Along the way, I've gotten quite a bit of training and experience doing software development projects of various types.  Early on, as a kid who had only had very basic computer experience (just enough to play games), I definitely struggled.  However, as my skill level increased and the resources available expanded dramatically, I've gone from barely getting a programming project off the ground to being able to choose from a variety of APIs and languages to getting involved in things I just dreamt about in the early days.
</p>
<b>Computer Vision and Machine Learning</b>
<p>
One of my interests developed as I watched the DARPA Grand Challenge races.  I saw that one of the teams had attempted a dual camera solution (its vehicle went off the road early in the race, but there's no reason why in the long term we can't use vision).  As I was programming in Java at the time, I tried to make programs with that, and as you can imagine, they weren't anywhere close to fast enough with the hardware and the Java VM / way I was programming at the time.  Today, after many years of reading blogs and watching videos on online courses from around the world, this interest has pulled me into machine learning as well.  These days, I'm writing my own neural net API in Python for the practice, and making automated webscraping scripts to gather the datasets to train the neural net models (my current project is an image classifier using a webscraper that downloads all images related to a keyword).
Here are some of my favorite resources in this area:
<ul>
	<li>Adrian Rosebrock's PyImageSearch.com <a href="PyImageSearch.com">PyImageSearch.com</a> (I helped fund his latest Kickstarter to write a book on machine learning with Python)</li>
	<li>Harrison Kinsley's site: 
<a href="PythonProgramming.net">PythonProgramming.net</a> (Also - see his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex">Youtube channel</a>)
</li>
	<li>Professor Andrew Ng's
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Coursera Machine Learning course (free)</a>
</li>
	<li>Matt Mazur's blog post Step-By-Step Backpropagation: 
<a href="https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/ ">A very verbose description (which was really needed) on how to do gradient descent for a neural net</a> 
</li>
	<li>Jevois smart camera: <a href="Jevois.org">a small, super fast, camera that can run machine learning on the livestream</a> </li>
</ul>

Here is my project code so far:  <a href="https://github.com/DiginessForever/machineLearning">My machine learning github repo</a><br>

I also did a National Geographic Chasing Genius challenge submission video:

<b>Open data / transparent government</b>
<p>
I've been volunteering with a meetup group (has a strong mapping community and a few coders) that explores how to make processes more transparent / help community and government visualize issues.  Along the way, I've helped plan a couple hackathons, as well as been a competitor in GlobalHack's "Hacking Homelessness".
I've also experimented with Leaflet, a Javascript API that lets you download map tiles for a specific location (I used the browser's location features to center the map on the user): 
<a href="https://github.com/DiginessForever/randomCode/tree/master/Javascript/LeafletMapping/Example1">Example map you can insert on any webpage - centers map on your location</a>   (if you go up a directory, you can see some of OpenSTL's collected location datasets for Saint Louis)
Our next OpenSTL meetup group hackathon is:  
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Openstl/events/242678356/">Sat 23rd 10am-5pm at LaunchCode Mentor Center</a>
We will work on a portal to help Saint Louis visualize its vacant building issue.

<b>Helping other coders</b>
<p>
Being a programmer can be very frustrating to newcomers.  It is extremely difficult to get used to all the troubleshooting and following errors to the source of the problem.  The path of the beginner coder's learning curve can be a straight uphill climb-by-your-fingernails type of death march.  It doesn't have to be this way.  Having a good mentor can mean a world of difference.
With this in mind, I have engaged with:
<ul>
 <li>CoderVets (helping mentor 40 vets in creating their first mobile & webapp)</li>
 <li>UMSL (helping with online classes)</li>
 <li>as a student at LaunchCode with a mind to become a mentor later</li>
</ul>
